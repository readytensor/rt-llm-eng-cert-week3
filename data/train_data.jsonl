But I even managed to go to town and put flowers on the grave. It was his birthday.\nMerce: I know, I was there in the morning.\nTessie: Did you put a small pink stone on the tombstone?\nMerce: I did. It was a spontaneous idea to go to the cemetery, I didn't have any candles or flowers. I could have gotten him some from the shop opposite, but I somehow don't like all these things on graves. So bourgeois...\nTessie: Well I do like bringing him flowers, shells, stones... He's got quite a collection by now. Yesterday I put loads of dry hydrangea heads from the garden on his place.\nTessie: <file_photo>\nMerce: Oh that's fabulous! Very pretty!\nTessie: And not bourgeois?\nMerce: Not at all! You always do it in such a tasty and original way. He would like it, I'm sure.\nTessie: I only don't know how long they'll keep. Frost and snow will discolor them. What d'you think?\nMerce: I think they'll keep as nicely as they do on the bush. But if you want, I'll go and have a look from time to time. It will force me to have a walk!\nTessie: Thank you.

Why are they only doing this now?\nPaul: In what sense?\nBob: Why only now, with a very anti-immigration president, do they try to walkk in in large numbers. They had poverty and a desire to come to the US during the time of previous administrations, but only now are they coming in a big organised march like this.\nPaul: I see what you mean. The timing is strange, and around the mid-term elections. but maybe it is because this is the last chance.\nBob: You mean before the wall is finished. I have no idea if and when they will actually finish all of that.\nPaul: Probably they got inspired by what happened in Europe, how all those migrants got through into Europe and they are still there, nobody for sure knows how many.\nBob: Mayba, but this is a different country and the geograpy is very different. \nPaul: For sure they are getting a lot of help from someone.\nBob: It did look on the media as if ordinary Mexicans were helping them.\nPaul: I have a friend down there, Raul, he tells me that nobody is helping them and that the pictures on the news of Mexicans helping out of the goodness of their hearts is just to make it look like Soros isn't funding it.\nBob: Presumably some Mexicans will be giving them some charity\nPaul: Nobody. Ninguno. Nada. No Mexican is gonna give them jack shit because every one of them has a relative or friend who signed the proper application form and is waiting. They cannot stand these queue jumpers. If they were not being guarded by their organisers, the ordinary Mexicans would be beating them up.\nBob: Well it's interesting, what you say.\nPaul: I just don't know what's gonna happen when they actually get to the border in big numbers.\nBob: We won't have long to wait before we find out. \nPaul: If we really do find out the truth.\nBob: I wish they had webcams along the border so that we can see for ourselves. I can't trust the media anymore.\nPaul: You have to watch every side because they are all lying about everything and sometimes the truth is in the middle.\nBob: They even doctor the videos, and sometimes the videos are not doctored and the other side claims that they are.\nPaul: We live in very difficult times. It seems to be difficult to be sure about anything.\n## Summary:\n"}

Congrats!\nLiam: U deserved it, u worked so hard. :)\nChloe: Thanks :) But I couldn't have done it without u!\nLiam: I knew u would get the hang of it once u understood the basics.\nChloe: Ur just a great teacher! Really.\nChloe: I mean everything became crystal clear after the 1st lesson with u.\nLiam: I'm happy I could help.\nLiam: But without ur determination & mathematical intuition my help wouldn't have sufficed.\nChloe: I couldn't grasp anything in class.\nChloe: Mr. Anderson made me so nervous, he was a complete blocking point. \nChloe: It's like my mind turned off when he called me to the board.\nLiam: I know what u mean. He wasn't my favourite prof. either.\nChloe: The teacher makes such a difference!\nLiam: That's true.\nChloe: I'm so happy I have that behind me now.\nChloe: But this small success is definitely not changing my mind about math. I'm definitely heading towards humanities.\nLiam: I get ur point. U really need to be passionate about what u choose 2 study at uni.\nLiam: There's no point in torturing urself. I mean those are meant 2 be the best years of your life!\nChloe: Exactly, I'm celebrating this weekend!\nLiam: Awesome, u finally deserve a break after all that studying :)\n## Summary:\n"}

As for their medical services I do hope we won't have to try them out. Besides we both have  our foreign travel insurances with a guarantee of immediate transport to Europe, if need be. Fingers crossed!\nMary: Good! And you are extra careful too, I hope.\nCarol: But of course! We've rented a car to be independent of their erratic public transport and they seem to have a good network of fairly good roads. Mostly empty, sometimes even overgrown by vegetation on the sides.We never travel after dark of course.\nCarol: <file_photo>\nMary: Good Lord! It looks like a narrow tunnel through a dense jungle!

Our guidebooks are worthless, only this touristy crap.\nMary: Oh don't be so critical about them. They are destined for different readership. You'll catch up when back home.\nCarol: I hope I will! But with Will's operation looming over us, I might find it difficult. The thought about it seems to be bogging us down even here, but we avoid talking about it.\nMary: Oh Carol! Stop worrying!

So you are travelling again. What is it like there? How long are you staying there?\nCarol: Yes, Will insisted on a couple of months in the tropics before his hip operation, so we decided to go full bore and try again something rougher. So far everything's been going smoothly.\nMary: Isn't Mexico a bit dangerous? Have they got good medical care, just in case?\nCarol: We are in Yucatan only, which is pretty touristy and they put great store on safety as tourism's their major source of income. As for their medical services I do hope we won't have to try them out. Besides we both have  our foreign travel insurances with a guarantee of immediate transport to Europe, if need be. Fingers crossed!\nMary: Good! And you are extra careful too, I hope.\nCarol: But of course! We've rented a car to be independent of their erratic public transport and they seem to have a good network of fairly good roads. Mostly empty, sometimes even overgrown by vegetation on the sides.We never travel after dark of course.\nCarol: <file_photo>\nMary: Good Lord! It looks like a narrow tunnel through a dense jungle! Any big animals?\nCarol: They seem never to clear the sides of the roads, so the verges are kept clear of vegetation only on busy roads with much traffic. But most of their roads are like this, no one in sight for miles.\nCarol: <file_photo>\nMary: Would suit my driving!\nCarol: It soon becomes deadly boring. We tried to keep ourselves entertained by keeping the radio on and picking up as much Spanish as possible but it turned even a greater bore! 8D Anyway we're not overdoing it with driving. So much to see around!\nMary: Mayan monuments?\nCarol: Caught you here! Had made the same mistake myself. We've been instructed to say \"Maya monuments\"  as the adjective Mayan refers mostly to people and their languages.\nMary: Ooops! Once a teacher, always a teacher.\nCarol: :\u2011P No pro! Anyway we've been visiting all sorts of Maya monuments, mostly temples, but I still know precious little about them. Our guidebooks are worthless, only this touristy crap.\nMary: Oh don't be so critical about them. They are destined for different readership. You'll catch up when back home.\nCarol: I hope I will! But with Will's operation looming over us, I might find it difficult. The thought about it seems to be bogging us down even here, but we avoid talking about it.\nMary: Oh Carol! Stop worrying! It is a standard operational procedure, one of the most common surgeries. William is fit and has no known ailments that usually beset men of his age. It's going to proceed without any complications. Take my word for it!\nCarol: Thank you, Mary. I surely trust your opinion, after all you are a doctor. But you know what it's like.\nMary: Of course I do and I do understand you are upset. But please don't. Just enjoy your holidays!\nCarol: You are right. We'll make the most of them.\nMary: And take care too!\nCarol: XX\n## Summary:\n"}

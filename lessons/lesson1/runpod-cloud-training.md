# TL;DR

**Core Insight**: RunPod provides affordable, accessible GPU cloud computing for machine learning tasks when local hardware isn't sufficient
**Why It Matters**: As LLM sizes grow, cloud GPUs become essential for fine-tuning and training - RunPod offers one of the most cost-effective solutions
**Key Process**: Account setup ‚Üí SSH key generation ‚Üí Pod deployment ‚Üí Code synchronization ‚Üí Training execution ‚Üí Resource management
**Mental Model**: Think of RunPod as renting a powerful remote computer - you develop locally, sync to the cloud, train on GPUs, then retrieve results

# Scaling Beyond Local Hardware: Cloud Training with RunPod

LLM fine-tuning is computationally expensive and requires strong GPUs. As model sizes increase, you'll eventually need cloud providers like RunPod - one of the easiest and cheapest options available.

This lesson shows you how to get your code from local machines to RunPod, run training there, and retrieve results efficiently.

## Getting Started: Account Setup and Credits

Create a RunPod account at [runpod.io](https://runpod.io) and add credits (minimum $10). Disable auto-pay initially to control spending. You're only charged when pods are running - stopped pods cost ~$0.10/hour for storage.

## SSH Setup: Secure Remote Access

RunPod's web terminal can disconnect and interrupt long training jobs. SSH provides a reliable connection from your local terminal to the cloud machine.

### Generate SSH Keys

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Press Enter to use default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa)
# Press Enter twice for no passphrase (or set one for extra security)

# Copy public key to clipboard 
# macOS
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub      

# Linux
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Press Enter to use default location
# Press Enter twice for no passphrase

# Copy public key to clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
```

### Add Public Key to RunPod

Go to Settings ‚Üí SSH Keys ‚Üí paste your public key ‚Üí remove the email comment ‚Üí Update Public Key. Keep your private key secure on your machine.

## Creating Your First Pod

Go to Pods ‚Üí choose GPU (A40 recommended) ‚Üí name your pod ‚Üí keep default image ‚Üí enable SSH Terminal Access ‚Üí Deploy. The pod will take 1-2 minutes to start.

Once running, copy the SSH command and connect from your local terminal:

```bash
# Example SSH command (yours will be different)
ssh root@ssh.runpod.io -p 12345 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Understanding Persistent Storage

**Critical Rule**: Everything outside `/workspace` gets deleted when you stop your pod. Everything inside `/workspace` persists.

Always work in the workspace directory:

```bash
# Navigate to persistent storage
cd /workspace

# Clone your project repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git

# Navigate to your project
cd your-project
```

## Development Workflow: Local to Cloud Synchronization

Use Git to sync code between local and cloud:

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Create/edit files locally, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Add training script"
git push origin main
```

**Cloud Execution:**
```bash
# On RunPod (via SSH)
cd /workspace/your-project
git pull origin main
python train.py
```

**Development Tips:**
- Start with cheap GPUs for development, upgrade for actual training
- Stop pods immediately after training completes to save money

## Retrieving Results and Cost Management

**Small files** (logs, plots): Use Git to commit and push from cloud, then pull locally.

**Large files** (models): Push to Hugging Face Hub from your training script:
```python
model.push_to_hub("your-username/your-fine-tuned-model")
```

**Cost Tips:**
- Always stop pods after training completes
- Start with cheap GPUs for development, upgrade for actual training
- A typical 7B model training run costs ~$20-30

## Key Takeaways

- **RunPod provides affordable cloud GPU access** for when local hardware isn't sufficient
- **SSH setup enables reliable connections** - web terminals can disconnect during training
- **Everything outside /workspace gets deleted** - always work in the persistent directory
- **Use Git for code synchronization** between local development and cloud execution
- **Cost management is critical** - stop pods immediately after training completes
- **Start with cheap GPUs for development** then upgrade for actual training runs

Cloud computing opens possibilities for larger models impossible on local hardware. The key is balancing cost and computational power efficiently.
